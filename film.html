            <p class="short-description">Here I was strolling up to the top of Twin Peaks,
            San Francisco on a most glorious afternoon.  When the skies are clear,
            and they often aren't, the view of the Pacific Ocean is most welcome.
            And it's my belief that this pleasant sight is not lost on our avian friends.</p><hr>

            <p class="short-description">On a rare day trip through Alameda, I came across a terribly photogenic gaggle.  I reassured them to not mind me, that I was not there to compete for whatever precious resources this park had to offer.  I appreciated their hospitality and told them they would be most welcome in San Francisco.</p><hr>

            <p class="short-description">Sometimes it's wise to just have a gander out the window.  On this occasion I noticed three more of our fluttering friends huddled together on a street light.  Luckily enough I began recording in slow motion.  I thought perhaps they would take off all at once but they were nice enough to go one at a time.</p><hr>
