        <h4>Modern music depends on computers and software for at the very least recording and subsequent digital distribution. But software like Ableton Live, Reason and other DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) can become more than just a means to record music. These programs can be creative tools and instruments in and of themselves. Capturing sounds might only be the beginning of the journey...</h4>

          <p>What I like to call a view of the MIDI mountain range..  MIDI, or Musical Instrsument Digital Interface, is a technology protocol that can do many things to connect digital instruments. Among the most basic and important features is to send a melodic sequence of notes from one source to another.  In this case we have a melody created in Ableton Live, which is sent out of the computer through USB into a Korg SQ-1, which converts this digital melody into voltage which drives an analog oscillator. Utilizing this kind of conversion can provide us with both a lovely bit of electronic music as well as a fun visual accompaniment.</p>

          <p>This is a quick demo of one of my favorite plug-ins: the Eventide H3000 Band Delays.  It's basically an advanced delay effect which can create different timed delays that echo different filtered portions of the incoming sound. One way to get more out of this plug-in is to utilize the LFOs available within Ableton Live's Max for Live. The LFOs are essentially free running modulation sources and connecting them to the different bands within the plug-in allows for a great deal of movement that would otherwise not be possible.  Of course parameter automation within any DAW would achieve a similar effect, but utilizing the Max for Live LFOs feels more synth-like, and is just more fun.</p>

          <p>Here we're just having fun making a beat in Ableton Live.  One instrument is the Wavetable synthesizer which comes with Ableton Live Suite. Sending it notes one of my favorite Max for Live devices called the MDD Snake, which is inspired by the Make Noise Rene eurorack sequencer.  I like this device because it adds several features that are much more easily achieved in a computer device. It includes a random button which can reset all the note values. As long as we quantize these notes to a scale of some kind, the randomized notes will always generate a pleasant pattern. One further trick I like is connect a Max for Live square wave LFO to the randomize button, and then sync the LFO to the tempo of the song. This can allow you to completely change the notes of the sequence after a certain duration like 4 or 8 bars, and it will do so automatically. The other prominent synth sound in this video is a gliding sound. This is achieved by altering the time division of the Ableton Echo device. Again this time change can be controlled by a Max for Live LFO which will do this automatically and create electronic music which feels generative.</p>

          <p>I was a little skeptical when Reason 11 was announced with one of its main features being the whole program could be used as a plug-in within another program. I finally came to my senses and realized this was an incredible idea. Reason devices are so fun to use and can really spur your creativity especially when you are looking to break out of a routine for making music. At this point, Ableton Live has by far my favorite workflow of any DAW I'm familiar with, however one of its weaknesses is its built-in instruments. Most people will turn to external, hardware synths, as do I, but there is something fun sometimes about working "in the box", that is not leaving the computer, and feeling like all the tools you need (and have) are just a keypress or drag on the trackpad away. In this video, I was utilizing Reason's excellent Complex-1 Rack Extension device which is inspired by old west-cost style modular systems. It's fun to use, it sounds cool, the virtual patching is very familiar for a fan of eurorack, and being able to use it within Ableton Live makes for an excellent source of inspiration.</p>
