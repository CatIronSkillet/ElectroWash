        <h4>Synthesizers can do wonders for you. They can drain your wallet, turn minutes into hours, and help convince you that a sound you've created that would remind some of a heated battle between robot warriors, is in fact, music.  They can also be wonderful tools of inspiration that can provide divinely meditative ambience or absolute house-rattling basslines</h4>

          <p>While more of a sequencer and sampler than a traditional synthesizer, the Elektron Digitakt is an excellent tool for creativity, allowing you to import your own sounds and manipulate and layer them until you've got something truly original.  Some electronic instruments allow you seemlessly take an idea from your head and recreate it through the medium of the instrument.  The Digitakt is unlikely to be one of those because it forces you to work within its rules and confines.  However this can be extremely rewarding as you are guaranteed to end up somewhere you would not have otherwise imagined.</p>

          <p>Here we've got a classic patch of mine.  While some may call them boring waveforms, I often turn to classic sine waves and run them through a VCA with a short, plucky envelope.  In this case we have two oscillators each with a sequence controlling its pitch.  These two melodies then run through a delay unit which adds a nice rhythmic effect as well as stereo ambience.</p>

          <p>Here we have another example of oscillators run through VCAs with short, plucky envelopes.  This techinque can make simple waveforms more interesting and it can also tame more complex waveforms into something pleasant and percussive as evidenced by the sound that's almost reminiscient of a gentle beating of a bongo drum.  Also, there's a bird that obstructed my view as I was just trying to film the sun while sitting in Dolores Park, as one does.</p>

          <p>There's a bit more to unpack here but the layers involved are the nice, rich lead sound from the Moog Grandmother, another simple melodic voice from the Make Noise 0-Coast, and the more complex, rhythmic whirling sound from the eurorack skiff whose primary sound source is a Make Noise Dual Primary Oscillator (DPO).  The goal here is to create sound layers that are very distinct and can then coexist and still be heard when mixed together.  Of course layers of synthesizers coexisting tastefully is extremly subjective.</p>
